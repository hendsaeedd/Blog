    <h2>Hi there! I'm Hend👋</h2>
    <p>
      A Computer Science undergraduate student at Mansoura University. Welcome
      to my personal blog!
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from my academic pursuits, I'm passionate about web development and
      design. Creating interactive and visually appealing websites brings me
      immense joy. I also enjoy exploring the latest web technologies and trends
      to stay up-to-date with the fast-paced web industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this blog, I aim to share my knowledge, experiences, and insights
      related to web development. You'll find articles, tutorials, and resources
      on various web technologies, front-end frameworks, and best practices. I
      hope to inspire and empower aspiring web developers to build incredible
      websites.

      Being a Computer Science student has provided me with a solid foundation
      in programming languages, algorithms, and data structures. Through my
      coursework and personal projects, I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, and more. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to learn and
      grow as a developer.

      I'm a cat lady, through and
      through. I love everything about cats: their independent personalities,
      their soft fur, and their playful nature. I'm also really
      interested in the possibility of life on other planets. I think it's
      amazing to think that we're not alone in the universe. So, those are my
      four obsessions: coding, drawing, cats, and space. I know, it's a lot, but
      I can't help it! These things all make me happy, and they inspire me to be
      creative. I hope you enjoyed learning a little bit about me and my
      passions.<br />
      Good to know about me, Aside from my passion to make fast websites, I love
      photography/videography 📸, reading 📚, baking 🍰and running 🏃‍♂️.
